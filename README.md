# Le Jeu de la Guerre

A WEB implementation of Guy Debord's A Game of War ([Le Jeu de la Guerre](https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/Le_Jeu_de_la_guerre_(livre))). Powered by [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/).

## About the Game

Here are some materials about the game and its history.

- [BGG page](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27323/le-jeu-de-la-guerre)
- [On class wargames](https://www.classwargames.net/?p=1636)
- [Kriegspiel](http://r-s-g.org/kriegspiel/about.php)

## The Other Implementation

There is another digital implementation: [Kriegspiel](http://r-s-g.org/kriegspiel/index.php), made by Alex Galloway. There are an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjt8po_y4I) and a [playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l2M6vpWLAw) by Fred Serval. Unfortunately, it's only available on Mac and IOS, which inspires me to make a WEB version.
